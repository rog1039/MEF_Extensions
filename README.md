MEF_Extensions
==============

Code to make MEF easier to work with.

MEF provides weakly-typed Dictionary-style metadata and this code allows strongly-typed metadata and querying.
This code provides a few extension methods that operate on an MEF container to allow one to query for exports that satisfy a predicate function that operates on the strongly typed metadata.
